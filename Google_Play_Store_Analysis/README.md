# Project 2: 🍷 Wine Quality Prediction

## Objective
This project focuses on predicting the quality of wine (classified as "good" or "bad") based on its chemical characteristics. Three distinct classifier models were trained and evaluated to determine the most effective one.

## 🗝️ Key Concepts
- Classifier Models (Random Forest, SGD, SVC)
- Analysis of Chemical Qualities (e.g., density, acidity)
- Data Visualization with Seaborn and Matplotlib
- Model Performance Comparison

## 🤖 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
